# atomic-habit-reward-punishment-tracker
I made a reward punishment tracker for my personal use. I was reading atomic habits recently and this thought came into my mind. I'll set a goal (for example: pizza) and if I finish daily assigned tasks, for each task I'll add +1 and for every unfinished tasks/procrastination or bad habit - i'll deduct -1 from it.
